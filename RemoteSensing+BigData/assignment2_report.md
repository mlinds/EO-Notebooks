#  Q1: Illustrate the main differences/similarities you observe between the different classifiers and explain why they occur. 


# Q2: Illustrate the main differences in classification between the unsupervised and the best supervised classification of Step 2 and Explain why they occur. 



#  Q3: Illustrate the difference in accuracy between the different approaches and explain why?

 
 
# Q4: Illustrate the effect of adding the GLCM information to your classifier and explain which variables have a positive or negative effect on the classifier. Motivate your explanation. 



# Q5: Illustrate the effect of the SNIC algorithm and the integration of per-cluster properties on the classification accuracy and explain why? Also motivate your SNIC-algorithm settings.  


# Q6: Discuss what other approaches and improvements could be helpful to increase the performance of the classifier.
